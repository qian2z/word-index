# Word Index
Word Index is a Java program developed as part of my Year 1 Data Structures & Algorithms coursework. The program allows users to record the positions of words in text files within a specified directory and retrieve those positions upon request. It provides functionality to insert words from files, search for a specific word, add words from a new file, remove files from the word index, and print a summary of the word index.

## Features
- **Word Position Recording:** The program reads a set of commands from a given file and executes them sequentially. It initially requests to read all the words from available text files and inserts them into a map data structure.
- **Word Search:** Users can search for a given word in the word index, and the program retrieves the positions where the word appears in the text files.
- **File Operations:** The program supports adding words from a new file to the word index and removing files from the list of tracked words.
- **Summary Printing:** Users can request a summary of the word index, which provides an overview of the stored words and their positions.
